PracticeScheduler:

Goals:
Based on the user's maps of scores and levels,

	* Keep a list of current exercises to do.
		- The list should be created when the app is loaded, and updated when an exercise is done.
		- To make the list we should decide on an algorithm, for example:
			* Make sure that today the user played (otherwise we put them in the list) the two lowest scoring stages.
			* Put on three new stages, from the least played Fields.
				- For example, if we have four stages:
					Introduction Played(01/01/13)
					Notes		 Played(02/01/13)
					Positions	 Played(03/01/13)
					Chords		 Played(03/01/13)
				   We'll play the first three, because the user didn't play them lately (relatively to Chords).
		
	* Ask for an example: Manage the background notifications service:
	    - based on the user's preferences:
		
		( A suggested practice profile:
		    * How many minutes a day (Will determine how many exercises).
			* Around when?
			* Should we notify you (opt out).)
			
	* Create a global way (singleton or preferebally another way) to maintain the user information that
	  should be loaded and saved from the file system, as we've talked.
