	**** SUMMARY ****
The app's Activities would be simple and generic, to support different
Scenarios.

	MainActivity
		* Buttons: Start, Settings, Lessons, Tools.
			- Each button will lead to a different activities.
		* ExerciseActivity
			- The activity will be initialized with the intent properties containing the ExerciseStage to run.
			(StageId should be enough for the ExerciseManager to bring about the ExerciseStage).
			(Intent's are a sort of an IPC protocol between activities, and may be used to initialize them.)
